# hello-world
Hi, my name is Jonathan Smith.

I am a 20-year-old college student.
I like drawing, reading, writing, and browsing the Internet.
I'm also interested in AI and coding, which is why I'm here.

My dream is to make my own animated movies.
When I was 12, I wrote a book about a decorator crab. That's why I have "Crab" in all my Internet names.
